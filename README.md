# XU-Mini-M-MinUI-Extra-Paks
This is a collection of unofficial paks you can add to MinUI for the MagicX XU Mini M, in order to expand the capabilities of this lovely firmware.

## Installation
These instructions assume you have already correctly installed MinUI by following the readme in its base package.
1) Click the "Code" button on this page, then "Download ZIP".
2) Extract the ZIP, and merge the Emus, Roms, and Tools folders with those already present on your MinUI card.
3) Place the folders for your ports inside Tools/magicmini/PortMaster.pak.
4) Place the shell scripts to launch your ports inside Roms/Ports.

## Known Issues

none... at the moment?

## TODO

1) Finish the Readme.
2) N64, PSP, Dreamcast, and NDS paks.

3) The Amberelec team, for creating what would become the base of MOSS for the XU Mini M.
4) The PortMaster team, for all their amazing work that made it so much easier to create Ports.pak, etc.
