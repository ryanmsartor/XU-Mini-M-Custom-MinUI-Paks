# XU-Mini-M-MinUI-Extra-Paks
This is a collection of unofficial paks you can add to MinUI for the MagicX XU Mini M, in order to expand the capabilities of this lovely firmware.

## Contents
1) DOOM.pak - adds prboom libretro core running in MinUI's own MinArch.
2) FBNEO.pak - adds fbneo libretro core running in MinUI's own MinArch - be sure to grab map.txt for your Roms folder too.
3) GZDOOM.pak - adds gzdoom standalone, which is more flexible and better for playing Doom mods, but loses that nice MinArch in-game menu.
4) N64.pak - adds Mupen64plus standalone. Defaults to rice graphics driver; gl64mk2 driver available with minor launch.sh tweak.
5) PortMaster.pak and Ports.pak - add compatibility for PortMaster games. Both must be installed for the games to work!
6) RetroArch.pak - adds full-on RetroArch, in case there are cores or configuration options (such as applying shaders) that you miss when using MinUI proper.
7) VARCADE.pak - adds fbneo libretro core running in RetroArch, pre-configured with correct rotation, for playing vertical arcade games. Requires RetroArch.pak.
